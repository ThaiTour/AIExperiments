# AIExperiments
Collection of various Machine Learning experiments, demonstrated using TensorFlow in Jupyter notebooks.

## Projects

- First project involves creating a neural network that detects fraudulent credit card transactions. Project can be accessed [here](creditcard/ML1CreditCard.ipynb).

- Second project focuses on classifying 131 species of fruit, vegetables, and nuts using a convolutional neural network. Project can be accessed [here](fruitfind/fruitfind.ipynb).

- Third project simple network that predicts the `sin(x)` function. The overarching goal was to run this model on the ESP32. More information can be found [here](sine/sine.ipynb) and [here](sine/sine32), including some intermediate steps [here](sine/piecewise-linear.ipynb) and [here](sine/piecewise-sine.ipynb).

- Another project that implements rock-paper-scissors on an ESP32 with a camera connected. Supplementary projects ([ESP32CAM](https://github.com/ThaiTour/esp32cam/tree/main/rock-paper-scissors)) and ([TFLcam](https://github.com/ThaiTour/TFLcam)) capture the images used for training the neural network, and showcase the resulting end-product, respectively. This can even be used in a rock-paper-scissors [Lego Mindstorms robot](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sf4MbvWIKFw).
