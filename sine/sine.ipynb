    "which replicates an exercise from the book [**TinyML, Machine Learning with TensorFlow Lite on Arduino and Ultra-Low-Power Microcontrollers** by Pete Warden and Daniel Situnayake](https://tinymlbook.com/). \n",
    "The book is an e-book, and you can get a sample of the first chapters. \n",
    "The website now only gives 2 chapters, but in the past that was six (you might still find that somewhere), \n",
    "which includes the important chapter _Chapter 4. The “Hello World” of TinyML: Building and Training a Model_.\n",
    "This \"Hello World\" of ML is actually a network that \"predicts\" the _sin(x)_ given _x_.\n",

    "It seems that this \"Hello World\" was even a standard example of [tensorflow](https://www.tensorflow.org/); \n",
